# MemV: Memory Infrastructure for Video AI 🚀

> **Process once. Remember everything. Query instantly.**

MemV is a persistent memory and context infrastructure layer that transforms how AI systems understand and interact with video content. By creating queryable memory graphs from video data, MemV enables real-time insights at 40x speed improvements and 1% of traditional processing costs.

## 🎯 The Problem

Despite advances in foundation models, video understanding remains challenging in real-world applications. Current systems:
- Re-process videos repeatedly for each query
- Lack persistent memory across sessions
- Cannot integrate business context with video content
- Suffer from slow response times and high costs

## 💡 The Solution

MemV creates a persistent memory graph from video content, extracting three critical layers:

- **Episodic Context**: What happened in the video
- **Temporal Context**: When events occurred and their sequence
- **Semantic Context**: Relationships and meaning between elements

The system integrates external business documents (brand guidelines, product specs, campaign briefs) into a unified graph, turning raw video data into actionable business intelligence.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Persistent Memory Layer**: Query videos instantly without re-processing
- **Multimodal Knowledge Graph**: Unifies video content with business documents
- **Real-Time Performance**: Sub-100ms query responses with Redis caching
- **Cost Efficient**: 100x reduction in processing costs
- **Graph-Based Reasoning**: Complex queries like "Find moments where Product X appears after competitor mention and aligns with brand guidelines (section 3.2)"
- **Natural Language Interface**: Query your video intelligence using conversational language

## 🏗️ Architecture

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

**Context beats model size.** Most AI failures stem from context failures, not model limitations. MemV bridges the gap between raw video understanding and institutional knowledge, making foundation models truly usable in production environments.

## 🤝 Why MemV + Twelve Labs?

We amplify, not compete with, Twelve Labs. Like Pinecone powers OpenAI embeddings, MemV powers Twelve Labs outputs by adding:
- Persistent memory across sessions
- Business context integration
- Real-time query performance
- Cost-effective scaling

## 📚 Key Learnings

- Context engineering > bigger models
- Memory compounds over time
- Graphs + vectors = powerful combination
- Infrastructure unlocks foundation model potential

## 🌐 Vision

**MemV is contextual infrastructure for the AI-powered internet.**

Twelve Labs democratized video understanding models. We're making video memory and business context usable. Together, we're building the infrastructure for next-gen AI agents where video understanding meets institutional memory, and insights become truly actionable.
